Feature: Scanning Dependencies & Vulnerability Analyzing
  Background: Prepare source code for downloading
    Scenario Outline: Analyzing vulnerabilities from project downloaded
      Given the <githubUrl> to download
      When an request is sent attached with the zip file
      Then I expect the response with library count <libCount>, ecosystem <ecosystem>, includeSafe <includeSafe>, issuesCount <issuesCount>, libraryCount <libraryCount>, responseTime <responseTime>

      Examples:
        | githubUrl                                           | libCount | ecosystem | includeSafe | issuesCount | libraryCount | responseTime |
